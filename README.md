# FormulaVision
An Unofficial, Free & Open-Source app for Realtime Stats, Schedules & Track Data in Formula One

### NOTE
Currently the `Realtime Stats` only work on my (owner) local machine, as it is in alpha and unstable at the moment.
The stable features functioning properly are:
  -  Drivers Championship Standings
  -  Constructors Championship Standing
  -  Schedule for the Season

Features still in alpha (unstable) include:
  - Realtime Stats
  - HomePage Dashboard (Dependent on Realtime Stats Data)

Features to be Implemented
  - Authentication
  - Settings (Dependent on Authentication)
  - Themes
  - Scheduling Data fetching Revamp (currently fetched by parsing a `.ics` file, to be changed to fetch via the API)
  - Splash Screen
